# Bachelor-code
# This is the code used to create the plots and obtain the values presented in my Bachelor thesis 'Galaxies of the Cosmic Noon'.
# To run the code, all data described in section 3 of my thesis are needed. I am not permitted to publish this data.
# External packages are also needed to run the code. For statmorph, see: https://statmorph.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html. For SED fitting, see: https://johannesbuchner.github.io/PyMultiNest/)
